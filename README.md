# Cardly
**Card reminder** 

This is a study project to learn how to use **Koa.js** and **Sequelize** to build a basic API. **Jest** was another framework have thought to be used, but it does work fine with import/export from **Node.js** 14.12.0. So, I installed babel and extra necessary packages to **Jest** works.

This is a simple API. There are constrollers which works on **@koa/router** context, that controllers with core classes, bussiness logic. In the core classes there will the "algor√≠timo" to define the time between the revision of each *Card* from a *Deck*.

**Esdoc** has used to generate a basic doc for the project. This is my first time documenting my projects and improvingments is on the way.
